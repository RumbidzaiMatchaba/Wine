            From its very humble beginnings in 1852, the town of Robertson has always been filled with the most generous of people.
            Dr William Robertson, the Scottish minister whom the town is named after, the hard-working community that tends to the
            wine farms and everyone else here welcomes you with arms outstretched and warm handshakes.

            With the town a little more grown up by 1941, its stone church built by the community and serviced by missionaries,
            was no longer in use. It made the perfect place to establish Robertson Winery and was converted for winemaking and cellaring operations,
            involving everyone from farmers to bottlers in creating wines to share with the world.
